# Week 2

## Features

- `/` redirects to `/home`, which displays a basic HTML page.
- One can navigate from `/home` to `/create_product`, `/show_products`, `/search_product`, `/delete_product` or `/update_product`.
- `/create_product` and `/update_product` display HTML pages.
- `/search_product` and `/delete_product` need `?q=name of the product` to work as intended.
- A fair bit of error handling has been implemented.
- A test case to check for redirection from `/` to `/home` has been added.
